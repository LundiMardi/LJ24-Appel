###### With the theme “Between the Water and Us,” LJ24 aims to change the perception of water in the city and bring it back into our everyday view. Water shapes our cities. It is an essential element of urban quality and provides much added value.

By illustrating and changing our relationship with water in the city, LJ24 hopes to highlight this resource hidden under our feet and the many services it provides: not only drinking water but also water as a means of transport, a place of recreation and refreshment, a biotope rich in biodiversity, a source of energy, etc.

###### The “sponge city” approach illustrates how water can play a key role in the face of climate change, while improving the living environment, urban biodiversity and the wellbeing of inhabitants. This concept also questions the link between the city, its urban rivers and its lake.
