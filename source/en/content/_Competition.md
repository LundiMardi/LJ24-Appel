## Call for entries (closed)

###### As for the previous events, the creation of the works for Lausanne Jardins 2024 is subject to an international competition in order to maintain the level of excellence of the festival and the prestige acquired in the fields of landscape architecture and urban development. The call for applications will be launched on Monday, 3 October 2022. The programme and the description of the competition sites can be downloaded here.

## Objectives 
- Foreshadow emerging trends and future transformations (desired or undergone) in Lausanne.
- Develop innovative landscape art in order to make the city more beautiful as well as more resilient and capable of responding to the challenges of climate change, loss of biodiversity and pressures of use.
- Raise public awareness of the issue of resources, especially water and its cycle.
- Identify the potential of the lakeshore landscape by building on the existing structures, spaces and uses, and reveal and enhance the identity of the area.
- Encourage the appropriation of the public space in order to bring people together, foster dialogue and encourage inclusion.
- Design gardens that allow new sports, cultural, leisure and mobility practices to be experimented with.
- Make an impression by creating gardens that interact with the public, not only to by being seen but also smelled, heard, touched and even tasted.
- Go beyond the restricted framework of the event to offer ways of transforming, reusing or perpetuating the garden (with a view to sustainability).
- Encourage the participation of multidisciplinary teams capable of reflecting in an original way on the general theme and who are, at the same time, aware of and respectful of the constraints inherent in living organisms.

## Type of competition
The competition is organised in two phases:  
A.	The pre-selection of candidate teams.  
B.	The development of the projects by the selected teams.
At the end of the competition, the jury will determine which projects will be carried out for Lausanne Jardins.
