###### Lausanne Jardins is a cultural event that combines landscape architecture with reflection on the city. For one summer, the event offers a series of ephemeral gardens scattered over Lausanne, some of which are intended to prefigure the urban and landscape transformations of the city. Some twenty contemporary gardens, the result of an international competition, follow one another along a unique walk, encouraging people to stroll and to (re)discover unusual places. Dedicated to a wide public, the event is free and accessible 24 hours a day for four months, from mid-June to mid-October.

With its ephemeral installations, resulting in particular from an international competition, the work of the universities and the city’s services, Lausanne Jardins is an ideal urban laboratory, which helps test, in real life, projects that seek to improve the quality of use and the aesthetics of the chosen sites. The aim is to address the garden as a tool to transform, enliven and develop the city.

Since the first Lausanne Jardins, the Municipality of Lausanne and Association Jardin Urbain (AJU) have co-organised the festival. By renewing the legacy of the six previous events, in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, Lausanne Jardins helps enhance Lausanne’s image, giving it an international reputation in the field of garden art.

## The association 	

Association Jardin Urbain (AJU) was established in 1996 with a view to launching the first Lausanne Jardins in 1997. Its aims are to promote the art of gardening, to develop interest in urban gardens and, in general, in the relationship between built and planted spaces, and to encourage events on the theme of the garden in the city of Lausanne. 
Since then, AJU has worked towards and supported all editions of Lausanne Jardins.
